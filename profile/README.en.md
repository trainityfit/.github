## Thesis

Liftnotch is being built as a training operating system for coaches and athletes who need speed, operational clarity, and a premium product experience. The focus is not "fitness content." The focus is execution: planning better, logging without friction, and turning training data into usable decisions.

> Most application code remains private while the product is under active development. This public profile is focused on architecture, product direction, and ways to engage with the team.

## What We Are Building

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Coach Ops</h3>
      <p>Routines, assignments, follow-up, and daily operations for coaches managing real athlete progress, not scattered spreadsheets.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Session Logging</h3>
      <p>Mobile-first session logging for real workouts, optimized for speed, context, and minimum friction during training.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Metrics</h3>
      <p>Clear metrics for adherence, volume, progression, and operational visibility across a training block.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>AI Modules</h3>
      <p>AI capabilities kept separate from the transactional core for video review, technical feedback, and coach-assisted flows.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Architecture

```text
web (React / Vite)
        |
        v
api (Express)
        |
        v
db (MongoDB)
```

### System principles

- `controllers -> services -> repositories -> models`
- Input validation with `Zod`
- Clear domain roles: `trainer`, `client`, `independent`
- Mobile-first logging, desktop-first trainer operations
- AI modules isolated from the transactional core

## Engineering Thesis

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>We reduce friction in critical flows. The product has to feel fast during a real session, not only in a demo.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>Clarity</h3>
      <p>Clear contracts, explicit ownership, and an interface that does not ask users to parse noise.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>Durability</h3>
      <p>Architecture that is clean enough to evolve without rebuilding the product every few weeks.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## For Technical Talent

We care about people who think about product and systems at the same time.

- Engineering with product and UX judgment, not feature output alone.
- Clean backend boundaries, robust contracts, and real ownership.
- Frontend work with hierarchy, intention, and perceived performance.
- Interest in internal tooling, AI-assisted workflows, and execution quality.

## For Partners And Investors

Liftnotch is not trying to compete on content volume. The bet is to build product infrastructure for serious training.

- Coach operations with a focus on daily adoption.
- Mobile experience designed for the actual training moment.
- Technical foundation prepared for premium modules and AI-assisted workflows.
- Product direction driven by systems thinking, not interface polish alone.
